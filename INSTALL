Healpix 2.00 Installation
=========================

Every effort has been made to make the installation and usage of Healpix easy and straightforward.
However we highly recommend the user to read the documentation, even before everything else fails.
(see   doc/html/main.htm   or   http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/healpixSoftwareDocumentation.shtml)

Installing the F90 package
--------------------------
See 
   doc/html/install.htm  
or  
   doc/pdf/install.pdf 
for a detailled description of the installation procedure 
and the list of requirements.

If those requirements are met, simply running
   ./configure
   make
   make test
should be enough to install and test the package.
