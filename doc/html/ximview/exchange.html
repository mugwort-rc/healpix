<h2>Data exchange with the command line</h2>

If ximview is already running, as well as loading data from files, you
can transfer data from the IDL command line by simply running Ximview
again:
<pre>

HIDL> ximview, new_image, range</tt>

</pre>
<tt>new_image</tt> can be any of the input options available on 
initial startup, but
since file I/O is most conveniently done by the Load FITS menu option,
this is most useful for on-line data. All the 
<a href="comline.html">command line options</a> are available, 
except for those specifying the HEALPix projection which are ignored: the
projection always conforms to that for the images already loaded.

<p>You can also extract an image from ximview via
<pre>

HIDL> my_image = ximget('Temp')

</pre>
or 
<pre>

HIDL> Q_pol = ximget(1,/NO_COPY)

</pre>
The first argument specifies the tab (numerical values start at zero
for the leftmost tab).

<p>The <tt>/NO_COPY</tt> option removes the data from Ximview (deleting 
the tab in the process) to save memory.

<p>It is therefore possible to load images into Ximview, examine them,
extract them to the command line and perform further processing (eg
take the difference, extract a dipole, etc), and re-display the result
without the overheads of file I/O and conversion from pixel list to
grid.


<p>NB: bad and off-sky pixels are returned with value NaN.
