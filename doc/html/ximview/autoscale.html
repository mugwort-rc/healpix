<h2>Auto-scaling</h2>

The auto-scaling algorithm aims to scale the image so that
"noise-like" fluctuations around the zero level are visible but don't
use up too much of the colour scale, so that bright features are
visible rather than been completely saturated. The results depend on
the current <a href="menu.html#COLTAB">colour table</a> and 
<a href="transfun.html">transfer function</a>.

<p>It works in two stages:

<h3>Stage 1: Robust estimate of image rms and mode</h3>

This stage may be quite time-consuming for large images, but its
results are permanently recorded so it is not repeated if you need to
re-run auto-scale.

<p>Floating-point Not-a-Number (NaNs) and infinities are rejected as bad
data.  If more than 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> of the pixels are exactly zero, it is
assumed that zero also marks bad data and these are rejected.

<p>A first guess is made by finding the rms and mean of the good
data. These are used to choose bins for a histogram, covering &plusmn; 2&sigma;
around the mean, with enough points in each bin to make random
fluctuations unlikely to change the mode. If the modal bin falls in
the outer 20% of the histogram, the histogram is re-made with finer
bins, centred on the mode, and this is iterated if necessary.

<p>The final mode is found by a quadratic fit to the five bins centred on
the histogram peak. This is our estimate of the true zero level. The
noise estimate is the one-sided rms below the mode. You can plot the histogram
and quadratic fit if you run auto-scale from the 
<a href="menu.html#FILE">Load FITS</a> or 
<a href="menu.html#ADJUST">Adjust scaling</a> 
dialogs.  For large HEALPix images it is quicker to
run auto-scale when the data is first loaded, because then there is no
need to process the large number of "off-sky" pixels which pad out the
2-D projected image.

<p>NB: This algorithm will fail if the histogram is montonically
decreasing, e.g. in MEM images.


<h3>Stage 2: Choose the range, zero and beta</h3>

The estimated zero level is set to the mode. The beta parameter for
Asinh scaling is set to 2&sigma; (1.5&sigma; for the red-black-blue colour 
table).
<p>The image is classified as positive, negative or neutral according to
whether <i>(max &minus; mode) / (mode &minus; min)</i> is &gt; 5, &lt; 0.2, 
or in between. If
neutral, the scale is set symmetrically around the mode; if positive
it runs from <i>mode &minus; 3&sigma;</i> to a large positive value, 
and vice-versa
for negative images.  The scale is truncated at the actual minimum and
maximum if this prescription exceeds them. The total range is
chosen according to the colour table and transfer function in use.
For linear scaling it varies from 50&sigma; for the
very contrasty "Cyclic" scale to 18&sigma; for the "Red-black-blue"
scale. The ranges are 
squared for the Sqrt function, and the whole data range is used for
Asinh. Histogram equalization uses a nominal range of 400&sigma;.
