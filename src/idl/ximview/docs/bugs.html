<h2>Features and known bugs</h2>

Ximview and associated routines use IDL language features introduced
in version 6.0, and should run under any later version.

<p>When the cursor is positioned outside the image, the position reported
is the nearest pixel on the edge of the image.

<p>When response is slow, especially when the view window nearly fills
your computer screen, Ximview may not finish updating the view before
returning, leaving assorted square panels in the display either not
filled in, or filled with data from a previous zoom/pan state. These
will be progressively filled in with correct data when you pan the
view a bit more and/or automatically over the next few seconds.

<p>The Astrolib astrometry routines do not yet recognise butterfly
(i.e. NPOLE or SPOLE) projections, so astrometry is turned off for
IMSTATS and MAXFIT in this case.

<p>The astrometry routines may give a pixel coordinate offset by 360&deg; 
in longitude (hence off the image) from the correct position.

<p>Under windows, the cursor does not correctly change to the "dragging
hand" when panning.

<p>Occasionally Ximview launches an unwanted graphics window.  I have
tried to suppress this (again) but the bug is so rare it is hard to
tell if the fix worked. Please let me know if this happens to you.

<p>If Ximview crashes without properly exiting, I recommend the
following:
<pre>

HIDL> gscroll_tidy  ; Deletes invisible (PIXMAP) windows.<BR>
HIDL> heap_gc       ; Deletes any orphaned heap variables.

</pre>
