<h3><a name="FILE">File</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Load FITS</b></dt><dd>Launches a dialog box 
that allows you to choose a FITS file, specifying:
<ul>
<li>FITS extension 
<li>column list
<li>Whether to <a href="autoscale.html">auto-scale</a> the data 
(this affects the displayed
colours but not the image values themselves). If you select this option
you can choose to plot the histograms used to find the mode.
<li>a label for the tab, used as a prefix for the column label
in the fits file, if any. (If not specified, a label is 
constructed based on the FITS header which tries to 
distinguish the new tabs from those previously loaded.) 
</ul> 
If autoscale is not selected, after the file has been 
opened, Ximview launches the <a href="#ADJUST">Adjust scaling</a> 
dialog box.  To display the full range 
on each newly-loaded image, clear the "range" text box and 
click <b>Accept</b>. To set all images to the same scale, choose 
the settings you want and click accept. Otherwise, click 
<b>Clear tab choice</b> then select one image, choose the 
settings, <b>Accept</b>. The dialog re-appears until scales are 
set for all the images.
</dd>
<dt><b>Load image file</b></dt><dd>Reads an image file in any of the formats 
known to IDL, e.g. PNG, BMP etc. NB: as with Load FITS, the image must have
the same size as the currently-loaded images. As a result, this
option is not very useful but is included for development purposes.
</dd>
<dt><b>New logfile</b></dt><dd> Starts a new log file. The choices are to: 
<ul>
<li> overwrite the old log file
<li>make a file with a new sequence number, i.e. named 
 "ximview_<i>n</i>.log" where <i>n</i> is a unique number 
<li> <b>Named...:</b> you specify a filename via a pop-up box.
</ul></dd>
<dt><b>Write PNG</b></dt><dd>Dumps the currently-visible image area and scale
bar to a PNG file. A pop-up requests the file name. 
<p>NB under DirectColor the output image will be greyscale.</dd>
<dt><b>Reset</b></dt><dd> Makes the image window sensitive to cursor 
motions and re-enables panning, in case either of these have been turned off 
accidentally.</dd>
<dt><b>Exit</b></dt><dd>Ends Ximview.
</dl>

<h3><a name="DISPLAY">Display</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt><b><a name="ADJUST">Adjust Scaling</a></b></dt><dd>  
Launches a dialog box that allows you to change all the
scaling options:
<dl>
<dt><b> Choose Tabs</b></dt><dd> 
If there are multiple tabs, check the boxes for the 
tabs you want to adjust. 
<dt><b> Make current</b></dt><dd> 
Check the box for one tab to set the input values (and values for info
such as the full data range) to those currently set for this tab.
<dt><b>Colour table</b></dt><dd> 
Choose from the list. If <a href="#COLHANDLE">Colour handling</a> 
is set to "Same for all" (the default), 
this will be applied to all tabs (excluding RGB
tabs), unlike the other options.
See <a href="#COLTAB">below</a> for comments on each table.
<dt><b> Transfer Function</b></dt><dd> 
Choose from the list of <a href="transfun.html">transfer functions</a>.
<dt><b> Wrap colour table?</b></dt><dd> 
<dl>
<dt><b>No</b></dt><dd> image intensities outside the range set in 
<i>Data range for scaling</i> are displayed
as the minimum or maximum colour.
</dd>
<dt><b>Full</b></dt><dd> gives a cyclic mapping between image
intensity and TV colour: pixels with intensities within the 
scaling range are unaffected, 
but pixels outside the range map to a (multiply)
cycled colour instead of saturating.
</dd>
<dt><b>Bright end only</b></dt><dd> as for <b>Full</b> but only for 
intensities above the maximum of the scaling range. (Recommended).
</dd></dl> 
<dt><b>Full data range</b></dt><dd>  
For information. The units used here are adjusted
to scale the image maximum intensity into the range
[1, 1000) units, e.g. if the peak on the map is
0.123 K it will be reported as <I>123. mK</I>. Specify
the range in the same units (mK in this case).
<dt><b> Mode and Estimated rms</b></dt><dd> 
For information. Same units as the data range.
These values are only available if <a href="autoscale.html">auto-scale</a> 
has been run.
<dt><b> Plot histogram on autoscale?</b></dt><dd> 
If this box is checked before auto-scale is run,
a histogram of the values around zero is shown with
the derived mode marked (also the parabolic fit used 
to derive the mode). This allows you to check that the
value is sensible. 
<dt><b> Data range for scaling</b></dt><dd> 
Specify the image intensities that map to the 
faintest and brightest displayed colours (excluding
wrapping).
<dt><b> Beta for Asinh scaling</b></dt><dd> 
Sets the break between quasi-linear and quasi-
logarithmic scaling (see <a href="transfun.html">transfer
functions</a>).
<dt><b> Effective zero level</b></dt><dd> 
Set to your best guess of the image intensity level
corresponding to true zero. The reported values are
not altered, but this is used by the Asinh scaling
function, the red-black-blue colour scale, and
the <a href="preserve_col.html">preserve colour</a> option for RGB images. 
</dd></dl>
<p>Along the bottom of the box are the following buttons:
<dl>
<dt><b> Clear tab choice</b></dt><dd> 
Unsets all the tab selection checkboxes.
<dt><b> Autoscale</b></dt><dd> 
Applies the <a href="autoscale.html">auto-scale</a> algorithm to the "current"
image. The other tabs are automatically unselected as
a reminder that the values returned depend on the 
particular image. The image is not scaled right away; 
instead the suggested values of the data range, zero
level and &beta; are filled in (along with the Full 
data range, mode, and rms if not previously set). 

<p>Note: this may take a few seconds the first time it
is run. It is quicker to auto-scale HEALPix maps on 
input.

<p>The suggested values will be overwritten if you
make another tab current, but can be recovered 
instantly by clicking Autoscale a second time.</dd>
<dt><b>Accept</b></dt><dd> 
Applies the chosen scaling parameters to the selected
tabs.
<dt><b>Cancel</b></dt><dd> 
Don't change any scaling (but the full data range, 
mode, and rms are recorded if auto-scale has been 
run).</dd>
</dl></dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Auto-scale all tabs</b></dt><dd>Each image is auto-scaled. 
It just goes ahead and applies the
scaling, there is no request for confirmation.</dd>
<p> 
<dt><b><a name="COLTAB">Colour table</a></b></dt><dd> 
Select your prefered colour table:
<dl>
<dt><b>Rainbow</b></dt><dd>
Default on startup. Garish but gives good 
discrimination between levels.
</dd>
<dt><b>Heat</b></dt><dd>
Black-red-orange-white. Rather low contrast
</dd>
<dt><b>Blue-yellow-white</b></dt><dd>
Supposed to be a "colour-blind friendly" scale in
that it should look the same to the 5-10% of the 
male population with red-green colour-blindness.
</dd>
<dt><b>Greyscale</b></dt><dd>
Actually gives better contrast than "Heat", 
especially at low intensities.
</dd>
<dt><b>Red-black-blue</b></dt><dd>
Designed for images where the signal may have either 
sign, e.g. Stokes parameters <i>Q</i>, <i>U</i>, and <i>V</i>, velocity 
maps, or CMB maps. The intensity that maps to the
zero level is set to black, negative intensities
are coded red to white, and positive intensities are 
coded blue to white. The scaling to white is the
same on both sides, so if the range is lopsided, e.g.
&minus;1 to 10, only one side will reach white.
</dd>
<dt><b>Cyclic</b></dt><dd>
Constant saturation and intensity and hue cycling
through 360&deg;. Suitable for displaying phase
or polarization angle.
</dd></dl>
</dd>
<dt><b><a name="COLHANDLE">Colour handling</a></b></dt><dd> 
Choose:
<ul>
<li>Same for all: (Default)
Same colour scale for all tabs, except tabs 
displaying 3-colour images (RGB or HSV), which
always have their own scale.
NB: For TrueColor displays this requires re-drawing
all screens when the scale is changed, which may
take a few seconds. 
<li>Separate on each tab:
Each tab has its own colour table.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>Set view centre</b></dt><dd> 
Enter the position for the view centre in one of the 
following systems:
<ul>
<li>image pixels (x and y pixel coordinates)
<li>HEALPix pixel number in either RING or NESTED order.
<li>Longitude and latitude in degrees (in the native
coordinate system of the image).
</ul>
The view centre is defined as being the centre of a a pixel. 
You get the nearest pixel to the demanded position.
<p>Long/Lat is not yet enabled for butterfly projections.</dd>
<dt><b>Restore default screen size</b></dt><dd>Returns the Ximview window
to its initial size (512 &times 512 pixel image window).</dd>
</dl> 

<h3><a name="TABS">Tabs</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Blink Setup</b></dt><dd> 
Launches a dialog box with a checkbox matrix allowing you to
specify which tab appears at which point in the sequence. 
The matrix can be cleared with the <b>Clear sequence</b> button.

<p>You can also specific the blink period (per tab, not total)
in seconds, and choose to omit the scale bar, which can be
distracting if it differs between images.

<p>Click the <b>Done</b> button to start blinking immediately. 
Otherwise click <b>Cancel</b>.

</dd>
<dt><b>Red-Green-Blue</b></dt><dd> 
Launches a dialog box with a checkbox matrix allowing you to
assign any images already loaded to the red, green and blue
channels of a new image (a new tab is created for it). Two
colour scaling options are available:
<dl>
<dt><b>Saturate to white</b></dt><dd> objects that are saturated (ie 
displaying the maximum colour value) in all three 
channels will display as white. In this case the intensity scaling for each
channel is unchanged when the RGB image is created. If the scaling of any
channel is changed on the original tab, the RGB image will change to match,
but only when the underlying pixmap is updated, e.g. on a change of zoom or
significant panning. In the latter case the RGB image may be updated in some 
regions but not others, leading to odd-looking results.</dd>
<dt><b>Preserve colour for saturated pixels</b></dt><dd>uses the SDSS 
algorithm of Lupton et al. (2004), see 
<a href="preserve_col.html">Preserve colour</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Polarization</b></dt><dd>Options for displaying polarization 
information based on images already loaded. A dialog box allows
you to select two channels representing one pair of 
<ol>
<li> Stokes parameters <i>Q</i> and <i>U</i> 
<li> Polarized intensity and angle 
<li> Fractional polarization and angle. 
</ol>
In each case you can also choose a third channel representing 
total intensity (Stokes <i>I</i>).

<p>At present there is only one option:
<dl>
<dt><b>Colour</b></dt><dd>Makes a new tab. 
For two channels you get a Hue-Value (HV) image where 
hue (colour) represents polarization angle and value 
(brightness) represents polarized intensity (or 
fractional polarization for option 3).

<p>For three channels you get a hue-saturation-value 
(HSV) plot where hue is angle, saturation is 
fractional polarization and value is Stokes I.
Saturation is a linear scaling of fractional 
polarization from zero to a maximum you set in the 
dialog box.
For both HV and HSV the channel mapped to "value" uses 
the same scaling as already set on its original tab,
if available. For option (1) HV plots, the value (pol
intensity) is calculated on the fly and you get linear
scaling from zero to a maximum set in the dialog box.

<dt><b>Delete tab</b></dt><dd>
<dl>
<dt><b>Delete current tab</b></dt><dd>does just that, right away.
<dt><b>Specify</b></dt><dd> select from a list 
(includes a cancel option).
</dl></dl>
<h3><a name="ANALYSIS">Analysis</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Imstats</b></dt><dd> 
<dl>
<dt><b>Box</b></dt><dd>Select to use a square or 
rectangular box around the marked point to define the region for statistical
analysis (Default).</dd>
<dt><b>Region of interest</b></dt><dd>
Select the region to analyse using the IDL CW_DEFROI
routine: options of polygon, point, rectangle and
circle. Several such regions can be defined before
finishing; the union of all will be used. 
NB: the position readout on the CW_DEFROI window
is meaningless (but the readout on the Ximview 
window works as usual).</dd>
<dt><b>Set box size</b></dt><dd> in pixels.
Enter one number for a square box, two for a 
rectangle.
</dd>
</dl>
<dt><b>Peakfit</b></dt><dd> 
<dl>
<dt><b>Find extremum</b></dt><dd>
Default. Finds the largest maximum <i>or</i> minimum in the
search box.
<dt><b>Find maximum</b></dt><dd>
Does that, ignores minima.
<dt><b>Find minimum</b></dt><dd>
Does that, ignores maxima.
</dd>
<dt><b>Set box size</b></dt><dd>
Enter size of square box in pixels.
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><b>Clear mark</b></dt><dd>Unsets the current marked point and removes the graphics
marker.

</dd>
<dt><b>Set image properties</b></dt><dd>A dialog box allows you to select a tab,
see the current value of the property in question, and
 set a new value. These properties are used to check for
 image compatibility for certain options, currently only
 polarization display.
<dl>
<dt><b>Polarization</b></dt><dd>You can choose from a list of possible 
polarization products.
<dt><b>Frequency</b></dt><dd>You can choose from the list of frequencies
already loaded, or enter a new value. The value is
a text string, e.g. "K band" "408 MHz" etc.
</dl>
