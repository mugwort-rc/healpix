<h2>Note on command-line Fonts</h2>

The output sent to the terminal by Ximview is formatted assume
fixed-width fonts (e.g. for lining up output in columns). You get
this by default with linux, but if you run IDL under Microsoft
Windows, you are stuck in the "IDLDE" window, which by default uses a
variable-width font for its "output" window. I suggest you change this
via File -> Preferences in the IDLDE. (This also makes IDL's own error messages
more comprehensible).
