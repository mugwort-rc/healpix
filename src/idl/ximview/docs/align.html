<h2>Image alignment</h2>


Ximview keeps all images aligned, so that when swapping between tabs,
the same region is displayed in each case. This is only possible if
the images are all the same size, and if they have coordinate
information it must be consistent. All images loaded after the initial
set-up, via <b>Load FITS</b> or <b>Load image file</b> on
the <a href="menu.html#FILE">file menu</a> or via 
<a href="exchange.html">running Ximview again</a>, 
are checked for agreement and will be rejected if there is a
serious disagreement. Warnings are issued if the coordinates disagrees
in that one or other image does not have coordinates properly set
(including astrometry keywords for astronomical images).
