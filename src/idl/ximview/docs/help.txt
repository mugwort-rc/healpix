Introduction
============

Ximview is a utilty intended for quick-look inspection of HEALPix
images (as well as ordinary 2-D images) at the level of individual
pixels. Features include panning, zooming, blinking, image statistics
and peak finding.

Its strength is intended to be in reasonably efficient handling of
large images and display over broadband (LAN) network links, not just
on single workstations. Ximview is not intended for production of
printable or publishable graphics. It is very slow if run over the
internet. Ximview has been tested under Linux, Windows, and MacOS (but
needs more thorough testing on all platforms).

The default projection is the "HEALPix grid" defined by Calabretta &
Roukema (2007MNRAS.381..865C), which is a 5*nside square grid with the
Galactic plane running top-right to bottom-left. You can also choose
the "butterfly" projections (centered on a pole) described in the same
paper.


Simple Use:
===========

HIDL> ximview, 'test_iqu', '*'

If test_iqu.fits is a HEALPix map with 3 polarization channels, each
channel is loaded into a "tab" on the GUI. You can switch channels
either by clicking on the tab header, or by blinking between them
automatically.

You can pan and zoom over the images with continuous readout of
position and intensity. The second argument specifies that the
intensity range for each channel should be automatically scaled to
something (hopefully) sensible.

Instead of a file name you can specify various other kinds of input,
the simplest being on-line HEALPix arrays, 2-D images, or structures 
containing header and data, as produced by the HEALPix IDL routine 
READ_FITS_S.

Initially Ximview starts in "overview" mode, in which the entire image
is displayed scaled to fit into the display window. By clicking
anywhere with the left mouse button, you enter "zoom" mode, centred on
that point in the map. Initially, the scale is set to 1 image pixel
per display pixel (or larger if the image is so small that it all fits
on the screen). Only the latest marked point is remembered; earlier ones 
are erased from the display as soon as you pan or zoom.

Basic operations:

  Pan by dragging the image with mouse button 1

  Mark points by clicking mouse button 2 (also prints the pixel details on
  your xterm and in the log file).

  Zoom in or out (by factors of 2) with the buttons on the left-hand
  side Zoom factors of less than one are handled by decimating the
  input image (e.g. at zoom 0.5 only every other row and column is
  displayed). Ximview never changes the actual pixel values, e.g. by
  interpolating or binning.

  Reset the scale to 1 input pixel to 1 output pixel with the 1:1 button.

  Return to overview mode with the overview button. Unlike zoom mode,
  overview mode is not restricted to factor-of-two zooms but chooses an
  integer resampling factor to fill the display as much as possible.

  Clicking again enters zoom mode, this time at the last zoom you were 
  using.

  Resize the window, and the view will adjust to match (within reason).

Along the bottom of the window are buttons for the most useful tasks:

Blink on/off: start or stop blinking through the channels. This is done by
              copying the display on each tab in turn to a new temporary tab.
              (Simply selecting the tabs directly causes "flashing"
              which makes subtle changes harder to see). You can pan,
              zoom and swap tabs as normal while blinking is in
              progress, except that panning is not as smooth as usual
              since the blink tab is only updated at the blink rate
              (default 2 Hz).

Imstats: gets image statistics in a box surrounding the marked point,
         or a user-defined ROI ("region of interest"). The region analysed
         is briefly marked on the screen (erased when you pan or
         zoom).  The ROI option uses the IDL routine CW_DEFROI which
         launches its own dialog box. Note that this is usually
         part-hidden by the main Ximview window when it launches.


Peakfit: finds the maximum or minimum in a small box around the marked 
         point, and fits the 3 Ã— 3 pixels surrounding the local
         maximum with a quadratic to get sub-pixel (but not optimal)
         accuracy.

Detailed options are set via the menu bar.


Note for TrueColor displays
===========================

At IDL startup, before running Ximview or other graphics applications,
set:

HIDL> DEVICE, TRUE=24

if you are using a TrueColor display. Otherwise you will get
DirectColor mode, where the image is greyscale when the cursor is not
in the image region, and when it is there, the rest of your screen
will look bizarre. (However, changing colour tables will be much
faster).


Note on Command-line Fonts
==========================

The output sent to the terminal by Ximview is formatted assume
fixed-width fonts (e.g. for lining up output in columns). You get
this by default with linux, but if you run IDL under Microsoft
Windows, you are stuck in the "IDLDE" window, which by default uses a
variable-width font for its "output" window. I suggest you change this
via File -> preferences in the IDLDE.


Menu Bar Options
================

File:
     Load FITS   Launches a dialog box that allows you to choose a FITS file,
                 specifying:
                 * FITS extension 
                 * column list
                 * Whether to auto-scale the data (this affects the
                   displayed colours but not the image values
                   themselves). If you select this option you can
                   choose to plot the histograms used to find the
                   mode.
                 * a label for the tab, used as a prefix for the column label
                   in the fits file, if any. (If not specified, a label is 
                   constructed based on the FITS header which tries to 
                   distinguish the new tabs from those previously loaded.) 
                 
		 If autoscale is not selected, after the file has been 
                 opened, Ximview launches the "Adjust scaling" dialog box as 
                 described under the Display menu. To display the full range 
                 on each newly-loaded image, clear the "range" text box and 
                 click "Accept". To set all images to the same scale, choose 
                 the settings you want and click accept. Otherwise, click 
                 "Clear tab choice" then select one image, choose the 
                 settings, "Accept". The dialog re-appears until scales are 
                 set for all the images.

     Load image file
                 Reads an image file in any of the formats known to IDL,
                 e.g. PNG, BMP etc. NB: as with Load FITS, the image must
                 have the same size as the currently-loaded images. As a
                 result, this option is not very useful but is included for
                 development purposes.

     New logfile Starts a new log file. The choices are to: 
                 * overwrite the old log file 
                 * make a file with a new sequence number, i.e. named 
                   "ximview_<n>.log" where <n> is a unique number
                 * Named...: you specify a filename via a pop-up box.

     Write PNG   Dumps the currently-visible image area and the scale bar
                 to a PNG file. 
                 A pop-up requests the file name. NB under DirectColor the 
                 output image will be greyscale.

     Reset       Makes the image window sensitive to cursor motions and 
                 re-enables panning, in case either of these have been 
                 turned off accidentally.

     Exit        Ends Ximview.

Display:
     Adjust Scaling: 
                Launches a dialog box that allows you to change all the
                scaling options:
 
                     * Choose Tabs: 
                         If there are multiple tabs, check the boxes for the 
                         tabs you want to adjust. 

		     * Make current:
		         Check the box for one tab to set the input
		         values (and values for info such as the full
		         data range) to those currently set for this
		         tab.

                     * Colour table: 
                         Choose from the list. If Colour handling (see
                         below) is set to "Same for all" (the
                         default), this will be applied to all tabs
                         (excluding RGB tabs), unlike the other
                         options. See below for comments on each
                         table.

                     * Transfer Function:
                         Choose from the list. See section on transfer 
                         functions below for a full description.

                     * Wrap colour table? 
                         "No": image intensities outside the range set
                               in "Data range for scaling" are
                               displayed as the minimum or maximum
                               colour.
                         "Full": gives a cyclic mapping between image
                               intensity and TV colour: pixels within
                               the scaling range are unaffected, but
                               pixels outside the range map to a
                               (multiply) cycled colour instead of
                               saturating.
                         "Bright end only": applies only to intensities above
                               the maximum of range. (Recommended).
                           
                     * Full data range: 
                         For information. The units used here are adjusted
                         to scale the image maximum intensity into the range
                         [1, 1000] units, e.g. if the peak on the map is
                         0.123 K it will be reported as 123. mK. Specify
                         the range in the same units (mK in this case).
                     
                     * Mode and Estimated rms:
                         For information. Same units as the data range.
                         These values are only available if auto-scale has been
                         run.

                     * Plot histogram on autoscale?
                         If this box is checked before auto-scale is run,
                         a histogram of the values around zero is shown with
                         the derived mode marked (also the parabolic fit used 
                         to derive the mode). This allows you to check that the
                         value is sensible.

                     * Data range for scaling:
                         Specify the image intensities that map to the 
                         faintest and brightest displayed colours (excluding
                         wrapping).

                     * Beta for Asinh scaling:
                         Sets the break between quasi-linear and quasi-
                         logarithmic scaling (see section on transfer
                         functions below).

                     * Effective zero level:
                         Set to your best guess of the image intensity level
                         corresponding to true zero. The reported values are
                         not altered, but this is used by the Asinh scaling
                         function and, the red-black-blue colour scale, and
                         the "preserve colour" option for RGB images.

                     * Clear tab choice:
                         Unsets all the tab selection checkboxes

                     * Autoscale:
                         Applies the auto-scale algorithm to the "current"
                         image. The other tabs are automatically unselected as
                         a reminder that the values returned depend on the 
                         particular image. The image is not scaled right away; 
                         instead the suggested values of the data range, zero
                         level and beta are filled in (along with the Full 
                         data range, mode, and rms if not previously set). 

                         Note: this may take a few seconds the first time it
                         is run. It is quicker to auto-scale HEALPix maps on 
                         input.

                         The suggested values will be overwritten if you
                         make another tab current, but can be recovered 
                         instantly by clicking Autoscale a second time.

                     * Accept:
                         Applies the chosen scaling parameters to the selected
                         tabs.

                     * Cancel:
                         Don't change any scaling (but the full data range, 
                         mode, and rms are recorded if auto-scale has been 
                         run).

     Auto-scale all tabs:
                Each image is auto-scaled. It just goes ahead and applies the
                scaling, there is no request for confirmation.
            
     Colour table:                    
                Select your prefered colour table:
                     * Rainbow: 
                         Default on startup. Garish but gives good 
                         discrimination between levels.
                     * Heat:
                         Black-red-orange-white. Rather low contrast
                     * Blue-yellow-white:
                         Supposed to be a "colour-blind friendly" scale in
                         that it should look the same to the 5-10% of the 
                         male population with red-green colour-blindness.
                     * Greyscale:
                         Actually gives better contrast than "Heat", 
                         especially at low intensities.
                     * Red-black-blue:
                         Designed for images where the signal may have either 
                         sign, e.g. Stokes parameters Q, U, and V, velocity 
                         maps, or CMB maps. The intensity that maps to the
                         zero level is set to black, negative intensities
                         are coded red to white, and positive intensities are 
                         coded blue to white. The scaling to white is the
                         same on both sides, so if the range is lopsided, e.g.
                         -1 to 10, only one side will reach white.
                     * Cyclic:
                         Constant saturation and intensity and hue cycling
                         through 360 degrees. Suitable for displaying phase
                         or polarization angle.
     
     Colour handling:
                Choose:
                     * Same for all: (Default)
                         Same colour scale for all tabs, except tabs 
                         displaying 3-colour images (RGB or HSV), which
                         always have their own scale.
                         NB: For TrueColor displays this requires re-drawing
                         all screens when the scale is changed, which may
                         take a few seconds. 
                     * Separate on each tab:
		         Each tab has its own colour table.

     Set view centre: 
                Enter the position for the view centre in one of the 
                following systems:
                     * image pixels (x and y pixel coordinates)
                     * HEALPix pixel number in either RING or NESTED order.
                     * Latitude and longitude in degrees (in the native
                       coordinate system of the image).
                The view centre is defined as being the centre of a a pixel. 
                You get the nearest pixel to the demanded position.

Tabs:
     Blink Setup:
                Launches a dialog box with a checkbox matrix allowing you to
                specify which tab appears at which point in the sequence. 
                The matrix can be cleared with the "clear sequence" button.  

                You can also specific the blink period (per tab, not total)
                in seconds, and choose to omit the scale bar, which can be
                distracting if it differs between images.

                Click the "Done" button to start blinking immediately. 
                Otherwise click "Cancel".

     Red-Green-Blue:
                Launches a dialog box with a checkbox matrix allowing you to
                assign any images already loaded to the red, green and blue
                channels of a new image (a new tab is created for it). Two
		colour scaling options are available:
		     * "Saturate to white": objects that are saturated (ie 
                       displaying the maximum colour value) in all
                       three channels will display as white. n this
                       case the intensity scaling for each channel is
                       unchanged when the RGB image is created. If the
                       scaling of any channel is changed on the
                       original tab, the RGB image will change to
                       match, but only when the underlying pixmap is
                       updated, e.g. on a change of zoom or
                       significant panning. In the latter case the RGB
                       image may be updated in some regions but not
                       others, leading to odd-looking results.
                     * "Preserve colour for saturated pixels": uses the 
                       SDSS algorithm of Lupton et al. (2004),Described
                       in more detail below.

     Polarization:
                Options for displaying polarization information based
                on images already loaded. A dialog box allows you to
                select two channels representing one pair of
		(i) Stokes parameters Q and U 
                (ii) Polarized intensity and angle 
                (iii) Fractional polarization and angle. 
                In each case you can also choose a third channel representing 
                total intensity (Stokes I).

                At present there is only one option:

                     *  Colour: Makes a new tab. 
                        For two channels you get a Hue-Value (HV) image where 
                        hue (colour) represents polarization angle and value 
                        (brightness) represents polarized intensity (or 
                        fractional polarization for option iii).
			For three channels you get a hue-saturation-value 
                        (HSV) plot where hue is angle, saturation is 
                        fractional polarization and value is Stokes I.
                        Saturation is a linear scaling of fractional 
                        polarization from zero to a maximum you set in the 
                        dialog box.
                        For both HV and HSV the channel mapped to "value" uses 
                        the same scaling as already set on its original tab,
                        if available. For option (i) HV plots, the value (pol
                        intensity) is calculated on the fly and you get linear
                        scaling from zero to a maximum set in the dialog box.

     Delete tab:               
                     * Delete current tab ... does just that, right away.
                     * Specify            ... select from a list 
                                              (includes a cancel option).

     Imstats:
                     * Box:  
                         Image statistics will be calculated in a square or 
                         rectangular box around the marked point.
                     * Region of interest:
                         Select the region to analyse using the IDL CW_DEFROI
                         routine: options of polygon, point, rectangle and
                         circle. Several such regions can be defined before
                         finishing; the union of all will be used. 
                         NB: the position readout on the CW_DEFROI window
                         is meaningless (but the readout on the Ximview 
                         window works as usual).
                     * Set box size:
                         Enter one number for a square box, two for a 
                         rectangle.

                     * Find minimum
                         Does that, ignores maxima.
                     * Set box size:
                         Enter size of square box in pixels.

     Clear mark:     Unsets the current marked point and removes the graphics
                     marker.

     Set image properties: A dialog box allows you to select a tab,
		     see the current value of the property in question, and
                     set a new value. These properties are used to check for
                     image compatibility for certain options, currently only
                     polarization display.
                     * Polarization: You can choose from a list of possible 
                       polarization products.
                     * Frequency: You can choose from the list of frequencies
                       already loaded, or enter a new value. The value is
                       a text string, e.g. "K band" "408 MHz" etc.

Data exchange with the command line
===================================

If ximview is already running, as well as loading data from files, you
can transfer data from the IDL command line by simply running Ximview
again:

HIDL> ximview, new_image, range

new_image can be any of the options available on initial startup, but
since file I/O is most conveniently done by the Load FITS menu option,
this is most useful for on-line data. All the command line options are
available, except for those specifying the HEALPix projection which
are ignored: the projection always conforms to that for the images
already loaded.

You can also extract an image from ximview via

HIDL> my_image = ximget('Temp')

or 

HIDL> Q_pol = ximget(1,/NO_COPY)

The first argument specifies the tab (numerical values start at zero
for the leftmost tab).

The /NO_COPY option removes the data from Ximview (deleting the tab in
the process) to save memory.

It is therefore possible to load images into Ximview, examine them,
extract them to the command line and perform further processing (eg
take the difference, extract a dipole, etc), and re-display the result
without the overheads of file I/O and conversion from pixel list to
grid.

NB: bad and off-sky pixels are returned with value NaN.


Image alignment 
===============

Ximview keeps all images aligned, so that when swapping between tabs,
the same region is displayed in each case. This is only possible if
the images are all the same size, and if they have coordinate
information it must be consistent. All images loaded after the initial
set-up, via the "Load FITS" or "Load image file" menu options or via
running Ximview again, are checked for agreement and will be rejected
if there is a serious disagreement. Warnings are issued if the
coordinates disagrees in that one or other image does not have
coordinates properly set (including astrometry keywords for
astronomical images).


Transfer Functions
==================

The original image data is converted to displayed colour is a
two-stage process. First the image data scaled into the range [0, 255]
via a "transfer function", then these values are interpreted as
colours via the colour table.

The current transfer functions are:

* Linear: Output proportional to (intensity - range minimum)

* Sqrt:   Output proportional to Sqrt(intensity - range minimum)
          (or zero if argument is negative)

* Asinh:  Output proportional to: 

          Asinh((intensity - zero)/beta) - (Asinh((range min - zero)/beta).

          Zero and beta can be set via the "Adjust Scaling" dialog on the 
          display menu, or by auto-scaling.  This gives linear scaling for 
          |intensity| << beta, and logarithmic for |intensity| >> beta. 
          Choosing beta a few times the noise gives good results. The 
          default beta is 1 unit, which probably won't work.

* Hist Eq (Histogram equalization). Output is an irregular mapping of the 
          intensities between range min and range max, chosen to give equal 
          number of pixels per increment of the output scale.

Asinh scaling is strongly recommended for high dynamic-range images.


Auto-scaling
============

The auto-scaling algorithm aims to scale the image so that
"noise-like" fluctuations around the zero level are visible but don't
use up too much of the colour scale, so that bright features are
visible rather than been completely saturated. The results depend on
the current colour table and transfer function.

It works in two stages:

Stage 1: Robust estimate of noise and zero level:

This stage may be quite time-consuming for large images, but its
results are permanently recorded so it is not repeated if you need to
re-run auto-scale.

Floating-point Not-a-number (NaNs) and infinities are rejected as bad
data.  If more than 10^-5 of the pixels are exactly zero, it is
assumed that zero also marks bad data and these are rejected.

A first guess is made by finding the rms and mean of the good
data. This is used to bins for a histogram, covering +/- 2 sigma
around the mean, with enough points in each bin to make random
fluctuations unlikely to change the mode. If the modal bin falls in
the outer 20% of the histogram, the histogram is re-made with finer
bins, centred on the mode, and this is iterated if necessary.

The final mode is found by a quadratic fit to the five bins centred on
the histogram peak. This is our estimate of the true zero level. The
noise estimate is the one-sided rms below the mode. If you run
auto-scale from the "Adjust scaling" dialog, you can plot the histogram
and quadratic fit.  However, for large HEALPix images it is quicker to
run auto-scale when the data is first loaded, because then there is no
need to process the large number of "off-sky" pixels which pad out the
2-D projected image.

NB: This algorithm will fail if the histogram is montonically
decreasing, e.g. in MEM images.


Stage 2: Choose the range, zero and beta

The estimated zero level is set to the mode. The beta parameter for
Asinh scaling is current set to 2 sigma (1.5 sigma for the
red-black-blue colour table).

The image is classified as positive, negative or neutral according to
whether (max - mode) / (mode - min) is >5, < 0.2, or in between. If
neutral, the scale is set symmetrically around the mode; if positive
it runs from mode - 3 sigma to a large positive value, and vice-versa
for negative images.  The scale is truncated at the actual minimum and
maximum if this prescription exceeds them. The size of the range is
chosen according to the colour table in use, such that "noise"
fluctuations are visible. This varies from a range of 50 sigma for the
very contrasty "Cyclic" scale to 18 sigma for the "Red-black-blue"
scale. These values are for linear transfer functions. The ranges are 
squared for the Sqrt function, and the whole data range is used for
Asinh. Histogram equalization uses a nominal range of 400 sigma.


"Preserve Colour" Option
========================

The RGB dialog gives you the option of using the algorithm of Lupton
et al. (2004, PASP, 116, 816) to re-scale the input images to preserve
"true" colour. With this set, the colour displayed represents the 
*linear* ratios of the input channels, prior to any transfer function
scaling. When this option is chosen a second dialog box prompts you to
choose rescale factors for the three channels and a display range and
transfer function for the average image. This works as follows:

let T_i be the intensity in colour channel i, z_i be the zero level
recorded for that channel (via the "Adjust Scaling" dialog), A_i be
the rescale factors for each channel, and r_1, r_2 be the min and max
of the range set for the average image. We calculate

(a) Tc_i  = A_i * (T_i - z_i)           (corrected channel image)

   A_i can compensate for different units on different channels or just 
   rescale channels to get a more interesting-looking result.

(b) T_Av = (1/N_i) Sum_i ( Tc_i )        (Average over colour channels)

(c) F_Av = Transfer_fn(T_Av, r_1, r_2)   (Transformed average image)  
     
     (this maps r_1 to zero and r_2 to maximum brightness).

(d) F_i = (Tc_i - r_1) * (F_Av / T_Av)   (Transformed channel image)

F_i are used as the colour channels for the R-G-B image. They also
replace the displayed images on the original tabs (and look very
odd). The point is that the F_i have essentially the same ratio as
Tc_i (exactly so, if r_1 = 0), despite the possibly non-linear scaling
of the total intensity.  Even when F_Av is saturated at the maximum
value, the F_i preserve the "true" colour. Note: the overall scale is
adjusted so that the maximum F_i over all channels is equal to the
maximum colour intensity. This tends to give rather dim images
compared to the alternative, the "saturate to white" option.

The grey levels encoding off-sky and bad pixels are also preserved
(bad pixels in any channel make that pixel bad in all channels).

The original tabs can be restored via the "Adjust scaling" dialog, but
then the RGB image will revert to the standard "saturate to white".


Log file
========

Ximview always produces a text logfile containing

*   Program start time
*   Very basic header info for the data
*   Pixel data produced by clicking the middle mouse button
*   Output produced by Imstats and Peakfit.

By default the file is "ximview.log" and is overwritten each time
ximview is run. The name can be specified by the LOG keyword on the
command line or the "New logfile" option on the file menu.


Command line options for Ximview
================================

HIDL> ximview, input, range, {proj, /NPOLE, /SPOLE}, {order, /RING, /NESTED},$
               COLUMN=column, EXTENSION = extension, WRAP=wrap, /ROLL,  $
               NAME=name, LOG=logfile, /TEMPORARY, /VERBOSE

Input can be any of:

* Fits file name (with or without '.fits' or '.FITS' extension). Recognised
  formats are standard images (in the primary header and data unit or stored
  as an image extension), all-sky HEALPix arrays stored in binary table 
  extensions, and "CUT4" format partial-sky HEALPix datasets stored in 
  binary tables containing a "PIXEL" column, a "SIGNAL" column, and 
  optionally other columns.
* on-line HEALPix array 
* on-line 2-D image 
* Structure containing header and data (e.g. as produced by the HEALPix 
  IDL routine READ_FITS_S), containing images, all-sky HEALPix, or CUT4
  HEALPix. 
* IDL pointer to any of the above (also, the structure may contain
  pointers to the data columns, rather than the data arrays themselves).
* Array of IDL pointers to maps or HEALPix arrays.


range is usually [min,max] but can be a single number (scale from min
in data to "range"), omitted (use the full range of the data), or set
to '*' or 'AUTO' (auto-scale).

proj = {'GRID', 'NPOLE', 'SPOLE'} defines the projection (or sort
order) to be used if the input decodes to a HEALPix array. Default is
'GRID'; /NPOLE and /SPOLE provide shorthands for the other options,
which are "butterfly" projections centred on the North or South Pole.

order = {'RING', 'NESTED'} or /RING can be used to specify the HEALPix
pixel order if there is no FITS header available. The default is
'RING', so /RING is redundant (but present for completeness).

COLUMN = either the column number or column name for HEALPix FITS
files (for instance, WMAP files have column 1 = "TEMPERATURE" and
column 2 = "N_OBS").  In CUT4 files, the first column stored is always
"PIXEL", but this is read by default, so COLUMN = 1 refers to "SIGNAL"
and so on. For image files containing a stack of images, COLUMN
specifies the slice of the stack required. This option only works if
the input is a file or structure; if you supply a raw data array, do
the subsectioning first, e.g.

      HIDL> Ximview, iquv[*,0]

not

      HIDL> Ximview, iquv, COL=0 ; this will generate an error.

EXTENSION = the FITS extension to read. If not specified the program
looks first in the primary header and data unit (HDU), then in the
first extension, then gives up.

Set /WRAP to give a cyclic mapping between input intensity and TV
colour: pixels within the specified intensity range are unaffected,
but pixels outside the range map to a (multiply) cycled colour instead
of saturating.  Set WRAP=-1 to saturate for intensities below the
specified range and wrap above it, which is usually preferable.

Set /ROLL to tell the program to interpret the data as a HEALPix map
in 'GRID' form and hence allow panning across the 0/360 degrees
divide. This is set automatically if the program already knows the
format from the header, or because it converted the data into Grid
format itself.

NAME = a string used to title the plot; if not specified, one is
constructed from the file name and FITS header, if available.

Set /LOG to create a unique name for the log file ("ximview_1.log",
"ximview_2.log", etc), instead of the usual overwriting of
"ximview.log".  Or set LOG= a name of your choice.

Set /TEMPORARY to allow the program to overwrite the input data array,
thereby saving memory.

Set /VERBOSE to produce a lot of diagnostic and timing information.


Features and known bugs
=======================

Ximview and associated routines use IDL language features introduced
in Version 6.0, and should run under any later version.

When the cursor is positioned outside the image, the position reported
is the nearest pixel on the edge of the image.

When response is slow, especially when the view window nearly fills
your computer screen, Ximview may not finish updating the view before
returning, leaving assorted square panels in the display either not
filled in, or filled with data from a previous zoom/pan state. These
will be progressively filled in with correct data when you pan the
view a bit more and/or automatically over the next few seconds.

The Astrolib astrometry routines do not yet recognise butterfly
(i.e. NPOLE or SPOLE) projections, so astrometry is turned off for
IMSTATS and MAXFIT in this case.

Under windows, the cursor does not correctly change to the "dragging
hand" when panning.

Occasionally Ximview launches an unwanted graphics window.  I have
tried to suppress this (again) but the bug is so rare it is hard to
tell if the fix worked. Please let me know if this happens to you.

If Ximview crashes without properly exiting, I recommend the
following:

HIDL> gscroll_tidy  ; Deletes invisible (PIXMAP) windows.
HIDL> heap_gc       ; Deletes any orphaned heap variables.

Ximview has been significantly influenced by Google Maps, SAO Image
DS9, Aaron Barth's ATV (especially the Asinh scaling), and NRAO's AIPS
(for Imstats and Peakfit).  It makes essential use of the HEALPix IDL
library, and NASA's IDL Astrolib, especially the World Coordinates
System library and several FITS I/O packages.
