<H2>Credits</h2>

Ximview has been significantly influenced by 
<a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>, 
<a href="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9">SAO Image DS9</a>, 
<a href="http://www.physics.uci.edu/%7Ebarth/atv/">Aaron Barth's ATV</a> 
(especially the Asinh scaling), and 
<a href="http://www.aips.nrao.edu/">NRAO's AIPS</a> (for Imstats and Peakfit). 
It makes essential use of the HEALPix IDL library, and 
<a href="http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html">NASA's IDL Astrolib</a>, 
especially 
the World Coordinates System library and several FITS I/O packages. 

I would like to thank Tess Jaffe, Sam Leitch, Tony Banday, Stuart Lowe and 
Eric Hivon for testing, bug reports, and suggestions.

Thanks also to <a href="http://www.dfanning.com">David Fanning</a> for his 
invaluable website on IDL.
