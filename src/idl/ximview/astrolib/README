This directory contains routines from the IDL Astrolib
(idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov) which are used by Ximview, except for ones
included in the HEALPix 2.11 distribution.

These are: AD2XY, BSORT, EXTAST, MINMAX, SXADDHIST,
WCS_GETPOLE, WCS_ROTATE, WCSSPH2XY, WCSXY2SPH, XY2AD.

WCSXY2SPH has been modified from the Astrolib version of Oct 2007 to
improve handling of the -HPX projection.

XY2AD has been modified to reduce memory usage when processing large
arrays.

All the routines in this directory should run under IDL 5.6.
