Ximview Installation Instructions

To run Ximview you need:

1. IDL version 6.0 or higher. IDL is a commercial package available from
   ITT: see http://www.ittvis.com/idl/

2. The HEALPix IDL library. This is available under the GNU Public License
   as part of the HEALPix software collection, see:
   http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/index.shtml.

   Only the programs in the src/idl/ subdirectory of the HEALPix installation
   are required.

No compilation is necessary, you only have to ensure that the XIMVIEW 
and HEALPix directories are included in your IDL path, ideally with XIMVIEW
occurring first. If you have the NASA IDL Astrolib installed, make sure that
XIMVIEW occurs before the astrolib directory in your IDL path.

Position in the path is important because both XIMVIEW and HEALPix include 
versions of astrolib routines. Since these are updated often, there may be 
incompatibilities between the versions in your astrolib directory and the
ones required by Ximview; also XIMVIEW includes a custom version of one 
routine (WCSSPH2XY).
