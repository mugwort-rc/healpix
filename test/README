test data for Healpix 2.1

used by 'make test'

*.par: input parameter file of each code

*.fits: input data and reference for comparison of output

   --  cl.fits: input power spectrum 
        WMAP 1yr best fit, Spergel et al, 2003; with B modes = 0
        see  http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/
   --  cl_old.fits: input power spectrum of previous Healpix releases

see Installation Document for details


Note: 
     The file wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.fits 
 has been added in this directory for convenience, even though
 it is currently *NOT* used in any of the simulations included here.

 It is adapted from WMAP 5yr best fit model for l-CDM + SZ + lensing with B mode = 0
 input file = wmap_lcdm_sz_lens_wmap5_cl_v3.dat;
